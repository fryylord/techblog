## Installation

There is no installation necessary to use the existing server, the program is functional upon arriving at the landing page.  

It can be run locally, if the user clones the repository from github to the local machine.
After navigating to the clone repository in the command line, run npm install to install all dependencies. To use the application locally, run node server.js in your CLI, and then open http://localhost:3001 in your preferred browser.

## Usage

The website has multiple functions.  An unregistered user arrives at the landing page and can view existing posts and their related contents.
If the user wishes they can log in using the link in the menu bar.  Upon arriving at the log in page, the user can log in or register to create an account.
After logging in the user is presented with a dashboard allowing to create a new post, as well as a record of their previous posts.
The user can return to the main board as well, and now when they view posts, they have the ability to comment.
The user will stay logged in for a period of time, after which they will be automatically signed out if there is no activity.
